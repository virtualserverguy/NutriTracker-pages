# Getting Started with FuelFlow

Welcome to FuelFlow! This guide will help you get up and running with your nutrition tracking for endurance activities.

## What is FuelFlow?

FuelFlow is a real-time nutrition tracking app designed specifically for endurance athletes. Track your carbohydrate, sodium, and water intake during runs, rides, and other activities - all from your Apple Watch or iPhone.

## Quick Start

- watchOS 10.0 or later (for Apple Watch features)
- iCloud account (for sync across devices)

### 2. Initial Setup

When you first launch FuelFlow:

2. **Grant permissions** (if prompted):
   - Notifications - Get reminders during activities
   - Health app - Optional integration with Apple Health
3. **Pair your Apple Watch** - If you have one, ensure it's paired with your iPhone

That's it! No account creation or complex setup required.

### 3. Set Up Your Food Library

Before your first activity, add some foods to your library:

1. Tap the **Library** tab
2. Tap the **+** button
3. Enter details for your go-to nutrition:

**Live Activities (iPhone):**
Your active session appears on your Lock Screen and in the Dynamic Island, giving you at-a-glance stats without opening the app.

## Ending Your Session

1. Tap **End Session** on either device
2. Review your summary:
   - Total duration
   - Total carbs, sodium, water consumed
   - Hourly averages
   - Individual logs with timestamps
3. Tap **Done**

Your session is automatically saved and synced.

## Understanding Sync

FuelFlow uses a dual-sync strategy for maximum reliability:

### Instant Local Sync (Primary)
When your iPhone and Apple Watch are connected:
- **Speed:** Less than 1 second
- **Connection:** Bluetooth/WiFi Direct
- **Internet:** Not required
- **Works:** Even in airplane mode (with Bluetooth on)

**What syncs instantly:**
- Starting/ending sessions
- Logging food
- Logging water
- All session data

### CloudKit Sync (Backup)
When devices aren't in range or internet is available:
- **Automatic:** Syncs in the background
- **Reliable:** Apple's CloudKit infrastructure
- **Secure:** End-to-end encrypted
- **Cross-device:** Access on all your devices

**What this means for you:**
- Start a session on your iPhone, instantly see it on your Watch
- Log nutrition on your Watch during a run, instantly see it on your iPhone
- If devices are apart, everything syncs when they reconnect or via internet
