## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I sync between iPhone and Apple Watch?

Make sure you’re signed in to iCloud on both devices. The app uses CloudKit to automatically sync your food library and active run sessions.

### Can I use FuelFlow offline?

Yes! The app works completely offline. Your data will sync to iCloud when you have an internet connection.

### What nutrition data does FuelFlow track?

FuelFlow tracks three key metrics: carbohydrates (grams), sodium (milligrams), and water (liters). These are the most critical nutrition elements for ultrarunning performance.

### Can I export my data?

Absolutely! Use the Export feature to generate detailed reports of your runs, including hourly breakdowns and total consumption summaries.

### Is my data private?

Yes. All your data is stored in your private iCloud account. We don’t have access to your information, and we don’t share data with third parties.
