# Nutrition Logging & Food Library Guide

Master your in-activity fueling with FuelFlow's food library and logging system.

---

## Overview

FuelFlow helps you track three critical nutrition metrics during endurance activities:
- **Carbohydrates** - Energy for sustained effort
- **Sodium** - Electrolyte balance and hydration
- **Water** - Hydration and thermoregulation

Build your personal food library once, then log with a single tap during activities.

---

## The Food Library

### What is the Food Library?

Your food library is your personal database of:
- Energy gels and chews
- Sports drinks and mixes
- Bars and solid foods
- Water bottles and hydration
- Custom recipes

**Benefits**:
- One-tap logging during activities
- Consistent nutrition tracking
- Accurate macros for analysis
- Syncs across all your devices (iCloud)

### Accessing the Library

## Nutrition Tracking Strategies

### During Short Activities (<2 hours)

**Simple Approach**:
- Pre-load 2-3 favorites
- Log as you consume
- Don't overthink it

**Example Setup**:
- Favorite: "GU Energy Gel" (carbs only)
- Favorite: "Nuun Tablet" (sodium + water)
- Log when you take them

### During Long Activities (2-6 hours)

**Structured Approach**:
- Set hourly goals (60g carbs, 500mg sodium, 600ml water)
- Log every gel, sip, bite
- Check progress every 30-60 min

**Example Routine**:
- :00 - Start activity
- :30 - Gel + Water (log both)
- 1:00 - Check status (are you on track?)
- 1:30 - Gel + Electrolyte drink
- Repeat...

### During Ultra Events (6+ hours)

**Flexible Approach**:
- Front-load carbs in first 2 hours
- Mix gels + real food (avoid gut issues)
- Track sodium closely (heavy sweating)

**Pro Tips**:
- Use favorites for race fuel
- Add custom "Aid Station" item (mixed nutrition)
- Log immediately (memory fades when fatigued!)

## Logging Custom/Unknown Foods

### Quick Custom Log

**If you don't have time to add to library**:
1. Log Food → **Quick Custom**
2. Enter:
   - Carbs: 30g
   - Sodium: 200mg
   - (Optional) Notes: "Mystery gel at aid station"
3. Log

**Saved temporarily** - won't appear in library.

### Adding Unknown Food to Library

**At aid stations with unfamiliar products**:
1. Take photo of nutrition label (later)
2. During activity: Log as "Quick Custom" with estimate
3. After activity: Add accurate info to library

---

## Analyzing Your Nutrition

### During Activity

**Check Your Progress**:
- iPhone: Main screen shows live carbs/sodium/water
- Watch: Raise wrist for quick glance
- Live Activity: Lock screen widgets

**Color Codes**:
- 🟢 Green: On target (80-120% of goal)
- 🟡 Yellow: Slightly off (60-80% or 120-150%)
- 🔴 Red: Action needed (<60% or >150%)

**What to Do**:
- Green → Keep it up!
- Yellow → Adjust next intake
- Red (under) → Extra gel/water soon
- Red (over) → Slow down intake

### After Activity

**Review What Worked**:
1. Activity Detail → Nutrition tab
2. See timeline of all logs:
   - "30 min: Maurten Gel (25g carbs)"
   - "1:00: Water Bottle (500ml)"
3. Total consumed vs. goals

**On Route Map**:
- Nutrition markers show where you logged
- Correlate with terrain/effort
- Example: "I always bonk at mile 18 → need gel at mile 16"

## Tips & Best Practices

### Building Your Library

1. **Start small** - Add 5-10 products you actually use
2. **Use brand names** - "SiS Beta Fuel" not "Gel 1"
3. **Be accurate** - Check nutrition labels for carbs/sodium
4. **Favorite wisely** - Only star what you use every activity
5. **Review quarterly** - Remove products you stopped using

### Logging Strategy

1. **Log immediately** - Don't wait until end of run
2. **Use voice** - Shortcuts for hands-free logging
3. **Check progress** - Glance every 30-60 min
4. **Trust your body** - Goals are guides, not rules
5. **Adjust based on conditions** - Hot day = more sodium/water

### Race Day Prep

1. **Create race-specific favorites**:
   - "Race Day Gel" (your proven fuel)
   - "Aid Station Cola" (if you'll drink it)
   - "Water Cup" (250ml from aid stations)
2. **Practice logging** on long training runs
3. **Test new products** in training, never on race day
4. **Pre-load library** before race (avoid fumbling mid-race)
