# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: October 14, 2025**

This Privacy Policy describes how FuelFlow (“we”, “our”, or “the app”) collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our iOS and watchOS application.

——

## Our Commitment to Privacy

Your privacy is critically important to us. FuelFlow is designed with privacy as a core principle. We believe your nutrition and health data belongs to you, and you alone.

**Key Privacy Principles:**

- We do not collect, store, or have access to your personal data
- Your data stays in your private iCloud account
- No third-party data sharing or selling
- No advertising or tracking
- No analytics collection about your usage

——

## Information We Collect

### Data You Provide

When using FuelFlow, you create and manage the following data:

**Nutrition Data:**

- Food items (name, carbohydrates, sodium content)
- Water intake logs
- Run session data (start time, duration, consumption logs)
- Nutrition goals (hourly targets for carbs, sodium, water)

**Usage Note:** All of this data is stored exclusively in your private iCloud account. FuelFlow does not collect, transmit, or store any of this information on our servers.

### Data We Do NOT Collect

- Personal identification information (name, email, phone number)
- Location data
- Health data beyond what you manually log
- Device information or identifiers
- Usage analytics or statistics
- Crash reports (unless you opt-in through iOS)

——

## How Your Data is Stored

### iCloud Storage

FuelFlow uses Apple’s CloudKit framework to store and sync your data. This means:

- Your data is stored in **your private iCloud account**
- Apple encrypts data in transit and at rest
- We (FuelFlow) have **no access** to your iCloud data
- Only devices signed in with your Apple ID can access your data
- Your data is protected by your Apple ID password and device authentication

### Local Storage

Some data is cached locally on your device for offline functionality:

- Recent nutrition logs
- Food library items
- Active run sessions

This local data is stored securely on your device and is not accessible to other apps.

——

## How We Use Your Data

**Short answer: We don’t.**

Because your data is stored exclusively in your iCloud account, FuelFlow (the developer) never receives, accesses, or uses your data in any way. Your nutrition logs, food library, and run history remain private to you.

The app uses your data locally on your device to:

- Display your nutrition progress
- Calculate hourly consumption rates
- Generate export reports
- Sync between your iPhone and Apple Watch

——

## Data Sharing

**We do not share your data with anyone.** Period.

Your nutrition data is never:

- Sold to third parties
- Shared with advertisers
- Used for marketing purposes
- Transmitted to our servers
- Shared with other users
- Provided to data brokers

### Export Functionality

FuelFlow includes an export feature that allows **you** to share your run reports. This is entirely under your control:

- You choose what to export
- You choose who to share it with
- You initiate the export action
- Exports happen through iOS’s native sharing system

——

## Third-Party Services

### Apple iCloud (CloudKit)

FuelFlow uses Apple’s CloudKit service to sync your data across your devices. Your data is subject to [Apple’s Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/).

Key points about iCloud:

- Data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- Apple cannot access the contents of your encrypted data
- You control your iCloud data through your Apple ID settings

### No Other Third-Party Services

FuelFlow does not integrate with, connect to, or share data with any other third-party services, including:

- Analytics platforms
- Advertising networks
- Social media platforms
- Health and fitness apps (unless you manually export and share data)

——

## Children’s Privacy

FuelFlow is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the applicable age of consent in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at [info@fuelflow.run](mailto:info@fuelflow.run).

Given that FuelFlow stores all data in the user’s iCloud account and we have no access to that data, we have no way to identify users by age.

——

## International Users

FuelFlow is available worldwide. If you use FuelFlow outside the United States, please be aware that your data is stored in your iCloud account, which may be processed in any country where Apple operates data centers.

Your use of FuelFlow and the storage of your data in iCloud is subject to Apple’s international data transfer practices as described in [Apple’s Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/).

## Security

While we don’t store your data on our servers, we take security seriously in our app design:

- Communication with iCloud uses TLS encryption
