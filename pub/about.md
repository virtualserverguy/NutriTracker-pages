# About NutrιTracker

## Our Mission

NutrιTracker exists to help ultra marathon athletes optimize their nutrition and achieve their endurance goals. We believe that proper fueling is just as important as training, and we're dedicated to making race day nutrition management simple, effective, and data-driven.

## Our Story

NutrιTracker was born on the trails. After one too many bonks, stomach issues, and cramping episodes during ultra marathons, we realized that most nutrition tracking tools weren't built with endurance athletes in mind. Traditional apps focused on daily calorie counting and weight loss, not the unique demands of fueling 50, 100, or 200-mile efforts.

We set out to create a tool specifically for ultra runners—something that could be used during races, that understood hourly calorie rates, that tracked electrolytes as carefully as energy intake, and that helped athletes perfect their fueling strategy before race day.

Since our launch, we've been used to track nutrition during thousands of ultra marathon finishes, from 50Ks to multi-day stage races. Our community includes weekend warriors tackling their first 50-miler and elite athletes competing at the front of the pack.

## Our Values

### Built by Runners, for Runners
Every feature we develop is informed by real experience on the trails. We understand the challenges of fueling during ultras because we've faced them ourselves.

### Simplicity Under Pressure
When you're 60 miles into a hundred-miler, the last thing you need is a complicated app. We prioritize ease of use when it matters most—during the race.

### Data-Driven Performance
We believe in the power of data to improve performance. By tracking your nutrition carefully, you can identify what works, what doesn't, and continually optimize your approach.

### Privacy & Security
Your training data and race strategies are yours alone. We never sell your information or share it without your explicit permission.

## The Ultra Difference

Ultra marathon nutrition is fundamentally different from everyday eating or even marathon fueling:
- **Duration**: Events lasting 6 to 30+ hours require sustained energy management
- **Intensity**: Lower intensity allows for real food consumption and fat adaptation strategies
- **Conditions**: Extreme weather, elevation changes, and night running all impact nutrition needs
- **Cumulative Stress**: GI distress becomes a limiting factor as hours accumulate
- **Individualization**: What works varies dramatically between athletes and must be tested

NutrιTracker is designed specifically for these unique challenges.
