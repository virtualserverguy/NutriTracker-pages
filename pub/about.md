# About FuelFlow

## The Developer

Hi! I'm an iOS developer with a passion for ultramarathon running. FuelFlow was born from my own struggles managing nutrition during long-distance events. I found existing apps too complex for on-the-move logging, so I built something better.

My experience running 100-milers taught me that good nutrition tracking needs to be fast, simple, and accessible at a glance—especially when you're tired and moving. Every feature in FuelFlow reflects lessons learned on the trails, from the quick-tap logging system to the real-time hourly progress tracking.

Whether you're tackling your first 50K or your tenth 100-miler, proper fueling can make or break your race. FuelFlow helps you nail your nutrition strategy so you can focus on what matters: moving forward.

## The Story Behind FuelFlow

### The Problem
During my first 100-miler, I tried tracking nutrition in my heade. By mile 40, I was too exhausted to deal with thinking and remembering 'did I eat that?'. I ended up under-fueling and bonked hard at mile 70.

### The Solution
I knew I needed something that worked with an Apple Watch—something I could operate with one tap, even when my brain was foggy and my hands were clumsy. FuelFlow was designed to be:

- **Fast**: Log food in under 2 seconds
- **Simple**: No complex menus or data entry mid-run
- **Reliable**: Works offline, syncs when you have signal
- **Informative**: Real-time feedback on whether you're hitting your targets

### The Mission
Help ultrarunners dial in their nutrition strategy so they can focus on the run, not on complicated tracking systems. Whether you're training for your first ultra or chasing a podium finish, proper fueling shouldn't be complicated.
