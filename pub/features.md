## Core Features

### Apple Watch Integration
Log food and water consumption directly from your wrist during any activity. No need to pull out your phone—just tap and go. The Watch app displays your current progress and makes it easy to stay on top of your nutrition whether you're running, cycling, or in transition.

### Live Activities on Lock Screen
When you start a session, FuelFlow creates a Live Activity that appears on your iPhone Lock Screen and in the Dynamic Island (iPhone 14 Pro and newer). See your real-time stats without unlocking your phone:
- Current carb, sodium, and water intake
- Progress toward hourly goals
- Elapsed time
- Last logged item

Perfect for quick glances during activities or when your phone is mounted on your bike.

### Real-Time Progress Tracking
Monitor your carbs, sodium, and water intake with live progress bars showing how you're tracking against your hourly goals. See at a glance if you're ahead or behind your targets and adjust accordingly.

### Multisport Activity Tracking
Select your activity type at the start of each session:
- **Running** - Road, trail, ultra distances
- **Cycling** - Road rides, gravel, bikepacking
- **Triathlon** - Seamlessly track through swim, bike, and run segments
- **Multisport** - Adventure races, duathlons, or custom combinations

Track activity transitions during multisport events and maintain continuous nutrition monitoring across all segments.

### Custom Food Library
Build your personal food library with items you commonly consume. The app comes pre-loaded with:
- Energy gels (various brands and flavors)
- Nutrition bars and chews
- Sports drinks and hydration products
- Real food options for longer events
- Sport-specific nutrition items

Add your own custom items with carb counts, sodium content, and serving sizes.

### Hourly Breakdown
View detailed consumption statistics broken down by hour:
- Actual consumption per hour (grams/mg/liters)
- Rate calculations accounting for partial hours
- Compare hour 1 vs hour 2 vs hour 3
- Identify patterns in your fueling strategy
- Track nutrition across different activity segments in multisport events

### Goal Setting
Set custom nutrition targets based on your needs:
- Carbs per hour (default: 60g)
- Sodium per hour (default: 500mg)
- Water per hour (default: 0.5L)

Adjust goals on the fly based on conditions, effort level, or how you're feeling.

### Instant Sync
FuelFlow features lightning-fast synchronization between your iPhone and Apple Watch—changes appear in **less than 1 second**. Log a gel on your Watch during a run, and it instantly appears on your iPhone. Start a session on your iPhone, and your Watch updates immediately.

**How it works:**
- Uses Bluetooth or WiFi Direct (no internet required)
- Works completely offline—even in airplane mode with Bluetooth enabled
- Syncs everything: session starts, food logs, water intake, session ends
- Automatic and seamless—you'll never notice it happening

**Perfect for:**
- Remote trail runs without cell service
- International races with expensive roaming
- Ultra-distance events in areas with spotty coverage
- Any time you want instant feedback without relying on the internet

### CloudKit Sync (Backup)
When your devices aren't in Bluetooth range, FuelFlow automatically falls back to CloudKit sync via iCloud. All your data—including food library items, sessions, and nutrition goals—stays synchronized across devices. The dual-sync system ensures you never lose data, whether devices are together or apart, online or offline.

### Battle-Tested Reliability
FuelFlow's sync system is built to handle the toughest scenarios endurance athletes face:

- **Works in airplane mode** - Bluetooth keeps devices synced without cellular data
- **Survives device deaths** - Data saved locally, syncs when powered back on
- **Handles poor connectivity** - Queues changes, syncs when connection returns
- **Recovers automatically** - No manual intervention needed, ever
- **Ultra-tested** - Refined through real 50+ mile events and 24+ hour activities

**The bottom line:** You focus on your activity. FuelFlow takes care of the data.

### Water Logging
Quick water logging with customizable amounts. Track hydration alongside nutrition to maintain optimal performance throughout your event.

### Export & Reports
Generate comprehensive reports after your activity:
- Total consumption summary
- Activity type and duration
- Hourly breakdown with timestamps
- Average rates across the entire session
- Segment-by-segment data for multisport events
