### CloudKit Sync (Backup)
When your devices aren't in Bluetooth range, FuelFlow automatically falls back to CloudKit sync via iCloud. All your data—including food library items, sessions, and nutrition goals—stays synchronized across devices. The dual-sync system ensures you never lose data, whether devices are together or apart, online or offline.
