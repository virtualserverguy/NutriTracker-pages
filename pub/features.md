## Core Features

### Apple Watch Integration
Log food and water consumption directly from your wrist during any activity. No need to pull out your phone—just tap and go. The Watch app displays your current progress and makes it easy to stay on top of your nutrition whether you're running, cycling, or in transition.

### Real-Time Progress Tracking
Monitor your carbs, sodium, and water intake with live progress bars showing how you're tracking against your hourly goals. See at a glance if you're ahead or behind your targets and adjust accordingly.

### Multisport Activity Tracking
Select your activity type at the start of each session:
- **Running** - Road, trail, ultra distances
- **Cycling** - Road rides, gravel, bikepacking
- **Triathlon** - Seamlessly track through swim, bike, and run segments
- **Multisport** - Adventure races, duathlons, or custom combinations

Track activity transitions during multisport events and maintain continuous nutrition monitoring across all segments.

### Custom Food Library
Build your personal food library with items you commonly consume. The app comes pre-loaded with:
- Energy gels (various brands and flavors)
- Nutrition bars and chews
- Sports drinks and hydration products
- Real food options for longer events
- Sport-specific nutrition items

Add your own custom items with carb counts, sodium content, and serving sizes.
