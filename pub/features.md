## Core Features

### Apple Watch Integration
Log food and water consumption directly from your wrist during runs. No need to pull out your phone—just tap and go. The Watch app displays your current progress and makes it easy to stay on top of your nutrition without breaking stride.

### Real-Time Progress Tracking
Monitor your carbs, sodium, and water intake with live progress bars showing how you're tracking against your hourly goals. See at a glance if you're ahead or behind your targets and adjust accordingly.

### Custom Food Library
Build your personal food library with items you commonly consume. The app comes pre-loaded with:
- Energy gels (various brands and flavors)
- Aid station staples (pretzels, cookies, fruit, etc.)
- Sports drinks and hydration products
- Real food options for longer events

Add your own custom items with carb counts, sodium content, and serving sizes.

### Hourly Breakdown
View detailed consumption statistics broken down by hour:
- Actual consumption per hour (grams/mg/liters)
- Rate calculations accounting for partial hours
- Compare hour 1 vs hour 2 vs hour 3
- Identify patterns in your fueling strategy

### Goal Setting
Set custom nutrition targets based on your needs:
- Carbs per hour (default: 60g)
- Sodium per hour (default: 500mg)
- Water per hour (default: 0.5L)

Adjust goals on the fly based on conditions, effort level, or how you're feeling.

### CloudKit Sync
Start a run on your iPhone, continue tracking on your Apple Watch, and export data from either device. All your data—including food library items, active run sessions, and nutrition goals—stays in sync via iCloud. The food library page includes a bidirectional sync feature that forces a complete refresh of all CloudKit data across your devices, ensuring everything stays perfectly synchronized.
