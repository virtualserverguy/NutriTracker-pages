## Using This Library

When you first launch FuelFlow, you'll be asked if you want to load the default food library. Choosing "Yes" will import all these items into your personal food library. You can then:

- Add your own custom foods
- Edit any of these items to match your preferred brands/amounts
- Delete items you don't use
- Organize items however you like

The app fetches this data from `https://fuelflow.run/data/foods.json`.
